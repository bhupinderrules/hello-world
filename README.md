This is the first program I am writting in order to learn Github

Change #1
I am Bhupinder Singh, I find Github to be a bit difficult, I tried learning it in the past but wasn't anle to, All the tutorials were too complex to understand and used code, But now I think I can do this. Thanks to the tutorials provided by Github which I eluded me last time I was on Github.
